Implement locking in a binary tree. A binary tree node can be locked or unlocked only if all of its descendants or ancestors are not locked.

Design a binary tree node class with the following methods:

is_locked, which returns whether the node is locked
lock, which attempts to lock the node. If it cannot be locked, then it should return false. Otherwise, it should lock it and return true.
unlock, which unlocks the node. If it cannot be unlocked, then it should return false. Otherwise, it should unlock it and return true.
